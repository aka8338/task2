            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Nikola Tesla (1856–1943) was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist. He is best known for his groundbreaking work in the development of alternating current (AC) electrical systems, which laid the foundation for modern electricity supply systems.</p>
            <p>Tesla was born on July 10, 1856, in Smiljan, which was then part of the Austrian Empire (now in Croatia). He immigrated to the United States in 1884 and began working with Thomas Edison, but their professional relationship was short-lived due to differences in their approaches to electrical engineering.</p>
            <p>Tesla went on to establish himself as an independent inventor and researcher, securing numerous patents for his inventions and concepts. Some of his most notable contributions include the development of the AC induction motor and transformer, as well as the invention of the Tesla coil, a high-voltage electrical transformer.</p>
            <p>Throughout his career, Tesla demonstrated a remarkable vision for future technologies, envisioning wireless communication, renewable energy sources, and even the concept of a global wireless transmission system. Despite facing financial difficulties and experiencing periods of obscurity later in his life, Tesla's contributions to science and technology have had a lasting impact on the modern world.</p>
            <p>Nikola Tesla passed away on January 7, 1943, in New York City, leaving behind a legacy that continues to inspire scientists, engineers, and inventors to this day.</p>
